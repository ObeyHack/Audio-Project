# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [HebDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SLPRL-HUJI/HebDB).
As described in the dataset's page, the dataset contains:

A weakly supervised dataset for spoken language processing in the Hebrew language. 
HEBDB offers roughly 2500 hours of natural and spontaneous speech recordings in the Hebrew language, 
consisting of a large variety of speakers and topics. We provide raw recordings together with a pre-processed, 
weakly supervised, and filtered version. The goal of HEBDB is to further enhance research and development of 
spoken language processing tools for the Hebrew language.
